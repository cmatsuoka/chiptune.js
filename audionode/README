--AudioNode.js

This lib is intended to be a javascript implemention of the proposed Google Web Audio API 
by Chris Rogers http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/specification/specification.html

This will allow features to be quickly tested on the Mozilla Audio Data API implementation and be 
easy to adapt to changes as the specification matures.
